# LSC-001 - Lucas Siedschlag Corrêa

I'm a Systems Development student at Escola SESI de referência in Brazil. I love reading about philosophy and am always looking to learn something that challenges me personally.

Here you will find my school projects coordinated by Professor Ícaro and ideas that I probably had during the wee hours of the morning.
